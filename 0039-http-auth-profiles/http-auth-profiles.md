# Interledger HTTP Authentication Profiles
A minimal set of extensible, token-based profiles for securing Interledger relationships using HTTP.

## Motivation
Many Interledger protocols and software work well using HTTP. For example, [ILP-over-HTTP](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0035-ilp-over-http/0035-ilp-over-http.md) utilizes HTTP at the [Link Layer](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0001-interledger-architecture/). Additionally, Interledger software often uses HTTP for administrative functionality and other purposes.

This document defines common profiles that can be used to ensure implementations of Interledger software work securely in an interoperable fashion, while simultaneously allowing Interledger software operators to more clearly understand the trade-offs involved with various security choices.

The profiles defined in this RFC should:
 
* ...clearly define any trade-offs involved in choosing a particular profile.
* ...be easily implementable across programming languages in order to aid broad adoption.
* ...utilise well-known and broadly deployed protocols in order to increase confidence in the profiles.
* ...be suitable for high-performance use-cases, such as ILPv4 packet processing.
* ...resist replays (emphasis: resist, not necessarily be replay-proof, in order to support high-performance use-cases).
* ...not negate or prevent the ability of operators to layer-on more security "on top of" a profile defined in this RFC.

## Specification

### Overview
This document defines three authentication profiles for securing HTTP network connections in Interledger.

### Authentication
When authenticating requests between Interledger nodes, it is important to choose an algorithm that maintains an appropriate balance between usability and security, while at the same time maintaining high-performance _and_ interoperability.

In order to find this balance, this document defines three Authentication profiles, each with various trade-offs that should be considered before use:

* `SIMPLE`: Allows an ILP node to construct a potentially long-lived, randomly generated 32-byte [Bearer token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) that can be used by the producer of the token to authenticate incoming HTTP requests.

* `JWT_HS_256`: Allows two ILP nodes to utilize a previously agreed-upon shared-secret in order to _derive_ a `Bearer token` that conforms to the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification as defined in [RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html) using the `HS_256` signing algorithm defined in section 3.2 of [RFC-7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3.2).

* `JWT_RS_256`: Allows two ILP nodes to utilize public-key pairs to _derive_ a `Bearer token` that conforms to the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification as defined in [RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html) using the `RS_256` signing algorithm defined in section 3.3 of [RFC-7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3.3).

Peers MAY use any standard HTTP authentication mechanism to authenticate incoming requests, but SHOULD support `SIMPLE` and `JWT_HS_256` at a minimum.

#### `SIMPLE` Authentication Profile
This profile allows an ILP node to construct a potentially long-lived [Bearer token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) that can be distributed to clients who later use the token to authenticate with the node. 

Tokens in this profile MUST contain at least 32 randomly generated bytes.

Entites that interact with tokens in this profile fall into two categories:

* `Token-producer`: The entity that creates a token and verifies a presented token in order to authenticate an incoming request.   
* `Token-bearer`: The entity that presents a token to the producer in order to authenticate.

A token-bearer will supply a SIMPLE token as a credential when making HTTP requests to the token-producer. From the perspective of the token-bearer, tokens SHOULD be treated as opaque with no special meaning inferred from the structure of a token.

A token-producer SHOULD generate unique tokens for each token-bearer. This will allow the token-producer to control any implementation-specific properties of its tokens, such as expiry, replay-ability, or other characteristics that might apply to any particular use-case. 

For example, a token-producer may wish to create a SIMPLE token that consists of 32 bytes of random data (as required by this profile), but prefix this data with an account identifier. As long as the token contains at least 32 bytes of random data, and the token-bearer can treat the token as an opaque string, then this would be a valid token according to the SIMPLE scheme.

Token distribution from the token-producer to the token-bearer is out of scope for this RFC.
  
##### Example Usage
An example shared-secret in this profile is `user1234:HEiMCp0FoAC903QHueY89gAWJHo/izaBnJU8/58rlSI=`. From the perspective of the token-bearer, this token is opaque. However, from the perspective of the token-producer, this token includes additional information that can be used to for non-normative purposes.

In an actual HTTP request, this header would look like this:
```
Authorization: Bearer user1234:HEiMCp0FoAC903QHueY89gAWJHo/izaBnJU8/58rlSI=
``` 
 
##### Trade-off Summary
* **Pros**
  * The simplest, most usable profile -- just a string composed of at least 32 random bytes.
  * Very little processing time to verify a token (Note that token verification in this mode should utilize a Constant Time Comparison to avoid [Timing Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack)).

* **Cons**
  * The token secret is transmitted "on the wire" for every request, increasing the chances that it might be comprised. Compromise might occur through a variety of vectors, including: interception by a compromised TLS session (e.g., a [MITM attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)); a TLS termination endpoint that proxies the request (e.g., a Load Balancer); accidental or intentional logging by an internal system; or some other leakage.
  * Tokens in this scheme are not required to expire, so if an implementation neglects to rotate the token for a particular peer, tokens in this profile will likely be very long-lived. This increases the chance of compromise by an attacker. Additionally, compromised usage of this type of token could go undetected for very longer periods of time.
  * Requires out-of-band communication for token-bearers to acquire a token from a token-producer. 

#### `JWT_HS_256` Authentication Profile
This profile allows two ILP nodes to utilize a previously agreed-upon shared-secret, but then derive an [RFC-7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) compliant JWT token signed using the `HS_256` algorithm defined in section 3.2 of [RFC-7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3.2). This allows either party holding the shared secret to perform actual authentication by verifying the JWT using these algorithms.

##### JWT Claims
In order to be considered a valid JWT for this profile, signed JWTs MUST contain the following claims as defined in RFC-7519:
 
 * `sub` (subject): A claim that identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. See [Section 4.1.2 of RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.2) for more details.
* `exp` (expiry): A claim that indicates a date/time after which the token should be considered invalid. Implementations MUST reject any tokens with a missing or invalid expiry claim.  See [Section 4.1.4 of RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.4) for more details.

Implementation MAY utilize other claims defined in RFC-7519 such as `iss`, `aud` or others. The claims are optional for this profile on a per-peer deployment basis.

##### Example Usage
In this profile, the JWT is passed as an `Authorization` header in each HTTP request, using the [Bearer token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) scheme. 

One example of such a Bearer token:

`Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhbGljZSIsImV4cCI6MTU1ODAzNTg2OH0.__9CiSGdn4Grhl48slun7Lp4q4xt0uq398omcipBU8M`. 

Using the JWT specification, this token can be verified using the shared-secret previously agreed upon. For example, the above token contains a `sub` claim of `alice` and an `exp` claim of `1558035868`, which means this token is no longer valid after `May 16th, 2019 at 9:29:11 GMT`. This token can be verified using a shared-secret value of `HEiMCp0FoAC903QHueY89gAWJHo` (Base64 encoded).

##### Trade-off Summary
* **Pros**
  * JWT specifies a known encoding to allow both identity and authentication claims to be contained in single Bearer token.
  * Requires only enough processing to perform an HMAC-SHA256 signing operation, which is very fast.
  * Supports normative token expiry, which allows tokens to be generally short-lived so that peers can narrow the potential window of unauthorized usage in the event of token compromise.
  * The actual shared-secret is _never_ transmitted "on the wire" during any request. Instead, authentication tokens are always _derived_ from the shared-secret, which limits the risk of token compromise to the window of time that the token is not expired.

* **Cons**
  * More complex than the `SIMPLE` profile.
  * Potentially more computation required due to SHA-256 calculations and JSON serialization/deserialization (though this is somewhat muted if short-lived tokens are re-used across multiple requests).
  * Total transmitted bytes for authentication are slightly more than the `SIMPLE` scheme in the general case.
  * Requires out-of-band communication for both peers to agree upon the shared secret used to derive tokens.

#### `JWT_RS_256` Authentication Profile
This profile allows two ILP nodes to utilize public/private keys and an asymmetric signature algorithm to generate and verify auth tokens using different keys for signing and verification.
 
This profile relies upon JWT tokens that are signed using the `RS_256` signature algorithm defined in section 3.3 of [RFC-7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3.3).

##### JWT Claims
In order to be considered a valid JWT for this profile, a signed JWT MUST contain the following claims:
 
 * `iss` (issuer): A claim that identifies the principal that issued the JWT. See [Section 4.1.1 of RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.1) for more details.
 * `sub` (issuer): A claim that identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. See [Section 4.1.2 of RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.2) for more details.
 * `aud` (audience): A claim that identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. See [Section 4.1.3 of RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.3) for more details.
 * `exp` (expiry): A claim that indicates a date/time after which the token should be considered invalid. Implementations SHOULD reject any tokens with a missing or invalid expiry claim.  See [Section 4.1.4 of RFC-7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.4) for more details.

##### Example Usage
In this profile, the JWT is passed as an `Authorization` header in each HTTP request, using the [Bearer token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) scheme. 

One example of such a Bearer token:

`Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2V4bWFwbGUuY29tIiwic3ViIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9hbGljZSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vYm9iIiwiZXhwIjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.Vpa0XsMzFU95hPHhKYt8cd4HwbUz3F2Wt8tLXEkRZoU_z4xwktrfUxlrfOXZ5PxyVboDSZfNvUNhYawCx87M64JIyYDxGJbj1piu7m6F9_P3Qoi-h0bHmkk_K5x-CnFPqxBVhnWaqQFh3hzSzf0IHNJz5YMeZi4Mxgfxys-xcVKSrgel8xxMME4ns961ec49LurPpkvXIhXqsGXyBglgAe9tQBIpY-rbaq4dCLgHp6h2MFt-6h0z2HZ2B__uprRVoOOnK6s1-xQjS5wbKf7tez9u6o5ati2KjC94z8pOxG-OaCC4bW6G3aKjFwOtv4Xd-Qda1W37kda1cv4bb-qadg`. 

Using the JWT specification, this token can be verified using the public-key that corresponds to the private key that signed the token. For example, the above token contains the following claims:

* `iss`: https://idp.exmaple.org
* `sub`: https://example.com/alice
* `aud`: https://example.com/bob
* `exp`: 1516239022

The token can be verified using the following public-key, which in a production deployment can be advertised at a TLS-encrypted HTTP endpoint conforming to [RFC-7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517):
 
 ```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC0H891JhR+Stgx81JyZeU48F4VUAS7E/OKvaVG5OjE9c+iIp2WcYFHqWjeBfrcPS1ADnTbxiKDd5D7EGWLDkBGha9H7m2hH/4PhywHomltp4Z1W7HJISzIS5JvPWFctKeKmhEekMi24yhtf44NkZg2zQijzLMQuxfaPGoW/88omtuDVaqQUmt3/Vx3v8D5ejQ2N8p7BrvpiUPQy+ZakAJf7MG0+EnaCjgnGAc9Q9wEBgMq6ifAENLne6BtQvA34jiWEIGDuD/veUwe0r0Ao/ZipZfcRJKybYNHbs5YQoxXOI2qo8qPwFrF2AJzak8+MwaiFYrDzGk8nV3e3i38RH0p test@example.com
 ```

##### Trade-off Summary
* **Pros**
  * Similar benefits to the `JWT_HS_256` profile, but more securely supports the issuer claim because each party signs tokens with its own private key. This allows token verifiers to affirmatively know exactly who generated the token, for example when employing a 3rd-party token generator such as in delegated authentication scenarios.
  * Allows for asymmetric key rotation without forcing a peer to change a shared-secret by allowing a peer to advertise at a TLS-encrypted HTTP endpoint conforming to [RFC-7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

* **Cons**
  * More complex than the `SIMPLE` and `JWT_HS_256` profile.
  * Total transmitted bytes for authentication are more than the `SIMPLE` and `JWT_HS_256` schemes. However, HTTP/2 header compression should mitigate this differential as well.
  * Requires out-of-band communication for both peers to agree upon public keys.
  * Verification performance is slower than the `SIMPLE` and `JWT_HS_256` profile.

### Authorization
The `HS-256` and `RS_256` profiles defined in this RFC rely upon signed JWTs, which support arbitrary claims that can be used for authorization decisions. This document does not define any authorization-specific primitives, although implementations MAY use various authentication claims in order to inform authorization decisions.

## Appendix1: Security Best Practices
This section outlines and clarifies some best practices for authentication-token security when using this profiles defined in this RFC. Recommendations in this section are _Non-Normative_, but highly RECOMMENDED.

### Follow Standardized Security Recommendations
It is advisable to follow all applicable best practices when using a Bearer-token scheme for authentication. [Section 5.1 of RFC-6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-5) contains a number of good practices that should be considered on a per-deployment basis. 

### Prefer SIMPLE Profile for Lower-value Scenarios
The `SIMPLE` authentication profile provides performance and simplicity benefits when compared to the `JWT_HS_256` or `JWT_RS_256` profiles, but introduces important drawbacks as outlined in the "Trade-off Summary" sections of this RFC. As such, the `SIMPLE` profile SHOULD be used for lower-value scenarios when possible.

### Use Reasonable Token Expiries
Tokens generators should choose a reasonable token expiry. Considerations in this choice include the ability to cache and re-use tokens for a limited time in order to enable very fast authentication decisions. However, this should be balanced against a desire for shorter token lifetimes, which will limit the attack surface caused by a compromised token.

As a best practice, implementations SHOULD use tokens that expire. For example, consider generating tokens with a lifetime that doesn't exceed 5 minutes.

### Secrets At Rest
Implementations SHOULD protect secret-values that can be used to generate authentication tokens by encrypting them prior to storage, and/or storing them in an encrypted storage device. This will help prevent actual shared-secrets or other sensitive data from being captured by unauthorized parties, increasing the chances that only Interledger software will be able to generate tokens.
  
### Secrets In Memory
Implementations SHOULD minimize the amount of time that an actual secret-value exists in-memory in unencrypted form. This includes narrowing the availability of secrets to only code that actually requires them; minimizing the time any secret might exist in memory; and zeroing out memory after a secret is no longer used, if possible. 

### Mutual TLS
All Interledger connections MUST be performed over a TLS session. However, it is also RECOMMENDED to use a certificate-based [Mutual Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) scheme, such as one that employs client certificates between peers for additional security. 
  
### High Security Deployments
For deployments requiring very high security, it is recommended to utilize a secret-store deployed outside of the Interledger software runtime, such as a key-management service and/or a hardware security module ([HSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module)). 

This will provide an extra layer of protection in the event that the Interledger runtime is compromised, and will also make it significantly harder for an attacker to compromise actual shared-secret or private key values. 

Before employing such a system, operators SHOULD perform extensive performance testing to ensure proper levels of service.
