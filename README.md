This repository contains a collection of various specifications and documentation related to the Interledger Protocol (ILP). These documents or requests-for-comment (RFCs) are published by various authors and publication here does not imply official status unless otherwise specified in the document.

For the main reference implementation of the ILP stack, see [Interledger.js](https://github.com/interledgerjs).

## Index

Here is a list of the main Interledger RFCs:

* **[1: Interledger Architecture](0001-interledger-architecture/0001-interledger-architecture.md)**

  Overview of the Interledger architecture.

* **[3: Interledger Protocol (ILP)](0003-interledger-protocol/0003-interledger-protocol.md)**

  Specifies the Interledger Protocol and Interledger Packet, which are used for sending payment instructions across different ledgers and connectors. This is the core protocol in the Interledger stack.

* **[4: Ledger Plugin Interface](0004-ledger-plugin-interface/0004-ledger-plugin-interface.md)**

  JavaScript interface for ledger plugins, which implement all functionality necessary to make Interledger payments through a ledger. This can be used as a model for defining such plugins in other languages.

* **[8: Interledger Quoting Protocol (ILQP)](0008-interledger-quoting-protocol/0008-interledger-quoting-protocol.md)**

  Specifies the protocol used for requesting a quote for an Interledger payment from a connector.

* **[9: Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP)](0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol.md)**

  A basic Application Layer protocol that uses HTTPS to exchange details needed to set up an Interledger payment.

* **[10: Connector-To-Connector Protocol (CCP)](0010-connector-to-connector-protocol/0010-connector-to-connector-protocol.md)**

  The protocol used by connectors to communicate routing information.

* **[11: Interledger Payment Request (IPR)](0011-interledger-payment-request/0011-interledger-payment-request.md)**

  A Transport Layer protocol in which the receiver generates the ILP Packet and condition.

* **[15: ILP Addresses](0015-ilp-addresses/0015-ilp-addresses.md)**

  Specifies the Interledger Address format for ledgers and accounts.

* **[16: Pre-Shared Key (PSK)](0016-pre-shared-key/0016-pre-shared-key.md)**

  The recommended Transport Layer protocol for most use cases, which uses a secret shared between the sender and receiver to generate the condition, authenticate the packet, and encrypt application data.
