**What was formerly known as the "Atomic Transport Protocol" has been removed from the standard Interledger Protocol stack.**

The Atomic mode outlined in the Interledger whitepaper may be used within segments of an Interledger payment path amongst groups of connectors and ledgers that support the required functionality. In an open system of interconnected ledgers, it seems unlikely that all parties in a payment path would have commonly trusted entities between them that could serve as notaries. The protocols used within specific groups need not be standardized because the failure to select commonly trusted notaries would prevent interoperability anyway.
