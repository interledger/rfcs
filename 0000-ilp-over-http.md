title: ILP Over HTTP

# ILP Over HTTP

This spec defines a minimal [Ledger Layer](./0001-interledger-architecture/0001-interledger-architecture.md#ledger-layer) protocol using the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It includes the Interledger payment fields (such as destination address) alongside those that are local to a specific hop (such as the transfer amount).

**Note:** This protocol is not to be confused with [HTTP ILP](./0014-http-ilp/0014-http-ilp.md), which defines HTTP headers for communicating payment details on a normal HTTP request to an application server. The values defined in this protocol will be forwarded to the destination ILP address defined in the request.

## Overview

It's everything you need to do ILP with just a couple of HTTP headers on a POST request/response. What more do we need to say?

## Specification

This protocol SHOULD be used with HTTPS or HTTP/2. It SHOULD NOT be used with insecure HTTP except for testing purposes.

### Request

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
ILP-Destination: g.crypto.bitcoin.1XPTgDRhN8RFnzniWCddobD9iKZatrvH4.~asdf1234
ILP-Condition: x73kz0AGyqYqhw/c5LqMhSgpcOLF3rBS8GdR52hLpB8=
ILP-Expiry: 2017-12-07T18:47:59.015Z
ILP-Amount: 1000

<body>
```

| Field | Type | Modified at Each Hop? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ILP-Destination` | [ILP Address](./0015-ilp-addresses/0015-ilp-addresses.md) | N | Destination address of the payment |
| `ILP-Condition` | Base64-Encoded String (With Padding), 32 Bytes | N | Execution condition of the payment, which is the Sha256 hash digest of the condition fulfillment |
| `ILP-Expiry` | [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) Timestamp in UTC | Y | Expiry of the transfer |
| `ILP-Amount` | Unsigned 64-Bit Integer | Y | Transfer amount, denominated in the minimum divisible units of the ledger. Note that this is the local transfer amount, **not** the destination amount as in the original [ILP Payment Packet Format](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0003-interledger-protocol/0003-interledger-protocol.md#ilp-payment-packet-format) |
| `<body>` | Binary, Maximum of 32767 Bytes | N | End-to-end data used by Transport Layer protocols |

### Response

#### Success

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ILP-Fulfillment: cz/9RGv1PVjhKIOoyPvWkAs8KrBpIJh8UrYsQ8j34CQ=

<body>
```

| Field | Type | Modified at Each Hop? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ILP-Fulfillment` | Base64-Encoded String (With Padding), 32 Bytes | N | Preimage of the `ILP-Condition` |
| `<body>` | Binary, Maximum of 32767 Bytes | N | End-to-end data used by Transport Layer protocols |

#### Error

HTTP Error Codes MAY be used to indicate certain types of failures, but [ILP Error Codes](./0003-interledger-protocol/0003-interledger-protocol.md#ilp-error-codes) MUST be used and relayed by connectors.

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
ILP-Error-Code: F02
ILP-Error-Name: Unreachable
ILP-Error-Triggered-By: g.usd.acmebank.user12345.xclkv-909sdf
ILP-Error-Triggered-At: 2017-12-07T19:11:21.917Z
ILP-Error-Forwarded-By: g.usd.acmebank.connector,g.crypto.bitcoin.1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa

<body>
```

| Field | Type | Modified at Each Hop? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ILP-Error-Code` | [ILP Error Code](./0003-interledger-protocol/0003-interledger-protocol.md#ilp-error-codes) | N | 3-letter code identifying the error |
| `ILP-Error-Name` | String | N | Human-readable name corresponding to the `ILP-Error-Code` |
| `ILP-Error-Triggered-By` | ILP Address | N | Address of the party that initially emitted the error |
| `ILP-Error-Triggered-At` | ISO 8601 Timestamp in UTC | N | Time when the error was initially emitted |
| `ILP-Error-Forwarded-By` | Comma-Separated List of ILP Addresses | Y | List of connectors that relayed this error. Connectors SHOULD append their ILP addresses to the end of this list when relaying the error |
| `<body>` | Binary, Maximum of 32767 Bytes | N | End-to-end data used by Transport Layer Protocols |
