## Interledger Protocol Explained Like I'm Five

### Introduction

A _protocol_ is set of rules about how to do something.

The Internet can be seen as a set of rules about how to send messages. For example, when a person follows the rules of the internet to send an email, it can be said that the person is _using the Internet Protocol to transmit information._

An _asset_ is a word meaning anything valuable. For example, money is an asset.

Interledger (aka _ILP_, or _Interledger Protocol_) is a set of rules about how to send assets. For example, when a person follows the rules of Interledger to send money, it can be said that the person is _using the Interledger Protocol to transmit an asset._

Interledger, just like the internet, isn't only used by people. It can be used by a computer, a group of computers, or a group of people or computers acting together as a company or corporation. The word _party_, whilst sometimes meaning a fun event with music and cake, can also mean a person, a thing, or any group of people or things that can _participate in an action._

The Interledger Protocol has four basic building blocks that are used together to transmit assets from one party to another.

### ILP Building Blocks
- Sender
- Receiver
- Connector
- Ledger

**Senders** want to send an asset to another party. Senders know the amount being sent and to whom. The act of sending something valuable can cost money, so senders should also be aware that what arrives could be less than what is sent, and be prepared to accept how much that could be.

**Receivers** are expecting or allowing an asset to arrive from another party. Receivers may know how much to expect, or to expect something to arrive but not how much.  It's also possible a receiver may not be expecting anything at all. (Surprise!)

**Connectors** want to connect a sender with a receiver, or many senders with many receivers. Connectors connect directly with senders and receivers, and also with other connectors in a _peer-to-peer network._ They do this so they can connect as many senders and receivers as possible, through a big or small (or medium-sized) chain of connectors.

**Ledgers** are like empty books that get written in to record how much each sender or receiver has of a particular asset. For example, a ledger for a group of people could record how many US dollars each person has. In the real world, an example of a ledger might be a banks list of its customers bank accounts and the amount of money each has.

_Note: In a real bank, it's possible for an account to hold multiple types of assets. For example, one bank account could hold amounts of US dollars, Euro's, and Japanese Yen. To keep things simple in the Interledger Protocol, each ledger is limited to recording how much different parties have **of exactly the same kind of asset**. If another asset is used by a sender or receiver, another ledger is used for that party. From ILP's point of view, a particular party may have several ledgers associated with them._
