                Crypto-conditions provide a mechanism to describe a signed message such that multiple actors in a
                distributed system can all verify the same signed message and agree on whether it matches the
                description.

                This provides a useful primitive for event-based systems that are distributed on the Internet
                since we can describe events in a standard deterministic manner (represented by signed messages)
                and therefore define generic authenticated event handlers.

            <t>
                This specification describes a message format for defining distributable event
                descriptions (crypto-conditions) and the cryptographically verifiable event messages
                (fulfillments) that can be used to prove that the event occured.
            </t>
            <t>
                The specification defines both binary and string-based encoding for the messages.

                <t>
                    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
                    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
                    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
                </t>
                <t>
                    Within this specification, the term "condition" refers to the hash of a
                    description of a signed message.
                </t>

                <t>
                    The term "fulfillment" refers to a description of a signed message
                    and a signed message that matches the description.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The description can be hashed and compared to a condition. If the
                    message matches the description and the hash of the description matches
                    the condition, we say that the fulfillment fulfills the condition.

                <t>
                    A "hashlock" is a tuple consisting of a bytestring and its hash where the
                    hash is published first and the publication of the corresponding bytestring
                    acts as a one-bit, one-time signature.

                    Crypto-conditions are a simple multi-algorithm, multi-level, multi-signature
                    standard format for expressing conditions and fulfillments.
                </t>

                <section anchor="multi-algorithm" title="Multi-Algorithm">
                    <t>
                        Crypto-conditions can support several different signature and hash algorithms
                        and support for new ones can be added in the future.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Implementations can state their supported algorithms simply by providing a
                        bitmask. It is easy to verify that a given implementation will be able to
                        verify the fulfillment to a given condition, by verifying that all bits
                        that are set in the condition's bitmask are also set in the implementation's
                        supported features bitmask.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Any new high bit can redefine the meaning of any existing lower bits when
                        it is set. This can be used to remove obsolete algorithms.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The bitmask is encoded as a varint to minimize space usage.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        By evaluating the bitmask of a condition actors in the system can establish, even
                        beforea fulfillment is published, if they will be able to verify the fulfilment.

                    <t>
                        Crypto-conditions can abstract away many of the details of multi-sign. When a party
                        provides a condition, other parties can treat it opaquely and do not need to know
                        about its internal structure. That allows parties to define arbitrary multi-signature
                        setups without breaking compatibility.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Protocol designers can use crypto-conditions as a drop-in replacement for public key
                        signature algorithms and add multi-signature support to their protocols without adding
                        any additional complexity.

                    <t>
                        Basic multi-sign is single-level and does not support more complex trust relationships
                        such as "I trust Alice and Bob, but only when Candice also agrees". In single level
                        2-of-3 Alice and Bob could sign on their own, without Candice's approval.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Crypto-conditions add that flexibility elegantly, by applying thresholds not just to
                        signatures, but to conditions which can be signatures or further conditions. That
                        allows the creation of an arbitrary threshold boolean circuit of signatures.

                    Each bit represents a different suite of features. Each type of condition depends on one or

                The following feature suites are defined in this version of the specification. New feature
                suites may be defined in the future and will be registered in the IANA maintained

                Support for a condition type MUST depend on one or more feature suites. Future versions
                of this spec MAY introduce new feature bits and condition types. However, all new
                condition types MUST depend on at least one of the new feature suites. This ensures
                that all previously created implementations correctly recognize that they do not support
                the new type.
            </t>
            <t>
                Feature suites are chosen such that they represent reasonable clusters of functionality.
                For instance, it is reasonable to require that an implementation which supports SHA-256
                in one context MUST support it in all contexts, since it already needed to implement
                the algorithm.
            </t>
            <t>
                An implementation which supports a certain set of feature suites MUST accept all
                condition types which depend only on that set or any subset of feature suites.

                    Preimage conditions can be used as a so-called hashlock. Since cryptographically
                    secure hashing functions are preimage-resistant, only the original creator of
                    a preimage condition can feasibly produce the preimage if it contains a large

                    create a condition which the creator can trivially fulfill by publishing the
                    random value. However, for anyone else, the condition is cryptgraphically hard
                    to fulfill, because they would have to find a preimage for the given condition

                    Prefix conditions provide a way to effective narrow the scope of other
                    conditions. A condition can be used as the fingerprint of a public key to
                    sign an arbitrary message. By creating a prefix subcondition we can narrow
                    the scope from signing an arbitrary message to signing a message with a
                    specific prefix.
