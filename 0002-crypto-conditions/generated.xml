    <abstract>


<t>Crypto-conditions provide a mechanism to describe a signed message such that multiple actors in a distributed system can all verify the same signed message and agree on whether it matches the description. This provides a useful primitive for event-based systems that are distributed on the Internet since we can describe events in a standard deterministic manner (represented by signed messages) and therefore define generic authenticated event handlers.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>This specification describes a message format for crypto-conditions and fulfillments, with binary and string-based encodings for each.</t>

<t>Crypto-conditions are <spanx style="strong">distributable event descriptions</spanx>. This means crypto-conditions say how to recognize a message without saying exactly what the message is. You can transmit a crypto-condition freely, but you cannot forge the message it describes. For convenience, we hash the description so that the crypto-condition can be a fixed size.</t>

<t>Fulfillments are <spanx style="strong">cryptographically verifiable messages</spanx> that prove an event occurred. If you transmit a fulfillment, then everyone who has the condition can agree that the condition has been met.</t>

<t>In the Interledger protocol, crypto-conditions and fulfillments provide irrepudiable proof that a transfer occurred in one ledger, as messages that can be easily shared with other ledgers. This allows ledgers escrow funds or hold a transfer conditionally, then execute the transfer automatically when the ledger sees the fulfillment of the stated condition.</t>

<t>Crypto-conditions may also be useful in other contexts where a system needs to make a decision based on predefined criteria, such as smart contracts.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

<t>Within this specification, the term "condition" refers to the hash of a description of a signed message. The hash function must be preimage-resistant.</t>

<t>The term "fulfillment" refers to a description of a signed message and a signed message that matches the description. We hash the description and compare that to the condition, and also compare the signed message to the description. If the message matches the description and the hash of the description matches the condition, we say that the fulfillment fulfills the condition.</t>

<t>In the simplest case, the fulfillment can be a preimage that hashes to the condition, in which case the preimage is both the description and the message.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="features" title="Features">
<t>Crypto-conditions are a standard format for expressing conditions and fulfillments. The format supports multiple algorithms, including different hash functions and cryptographic signing schemes. Crypto-conditions can be nested in multiple levels, with each level possibly having multiple signatures.</t>

<t>This format has been designed so that it can be expanded. For example, you can add new cryptographic signature schemes or hash functions. This is important because advances in cryptography frequently render old algorithms insecure or invent newer, more effective algorithms.</t>

<t>The <xref target="bitmask"></xref> of a crypto-condition indicates which algorithms it uses, so a compliant implementation can know whether it supports the functionality required to interpret the crypto-condition.</t>

<section anchor="multi-algorithm" title="Multi-Algorithm">
<t>The crypto-condition format contains a <xref target="bitmask"></xref> that specifies which hash function and signing scheme to use. Any message format for a condition or a fulfillment contains such a bitmask.</t>

<t>Implementations MAY state their supported algorithms by providing a bitmask in the same format. To verify that a given implementation can verify a fulfillment for a given condition, you compare the bitmasks. If all bits set in the condition's bitmask are also set in the implementation's bitmask, then the implementation can verify the condition's fulfillment.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="multi-signature" title="Multi-Signature">
<t>Crypto-conditions can abstract away many of the details of multi-sign. When a party provides a condition, other parties can treat it opaquely and do not need to know about its internal structure. That allows parties to define arbitrary multi-signature setups without breaking compatibility.</t>

<t>Protocol designers can use crypto-conditions as a drop-in replacement for public key signature algorithms and add multi-signature support to their protocols without adding any additional complexity.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="multi-level" title="Multi-Level">
<t>Crypto-conditions elegantly support weighted multi-signatures and multi-level signatures. A threshold condition has a number of weighted subconditions, and a target threshold. Each subcondition can be a signature or another threshold condition. This provides flexibility in forming complex conditions.</t>

<t>For example, consider a threshold condition that consists of two subconditions, one each from Agnes and Bruce. Agnes's condition can be a signature condition while Bruce's condition is a threshold condition, requiring both Claude and Dan to sign for him.</t>

<t>Weighted signatures allow more complex relationships than simple M-of-N signing. For example, a weighted condition can support an arrangement of subconditions such as, "Either Ron, Adi, and Leonard must approve; or Clifford must approve."</t>

<section anchor="binary-encoding" title="Binary Encoding">

<t>A description of crypto-conditions is provided in this document using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) as defined in <xref target="itu.X680.2015"></xref>. Implementations of this spec MUST support encoding and decoding using Octet Encoding Rules (OER) as defined in <xref target="itu.X696.2015"></xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="string-types" title="String Types">

<t>Crypto-conditions use the following types within string encoding:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='BASE10'>
  Variable-length integer encoded as a base-10 (decimal) number. Implementations MUST reject encoded values that are too large for them to parse. Implementations MUST be tested for overflows.</t>
  <t hangText='BASE16'>
  Variable-length integer encoded as a base-16 (hexadecimal) number. Implementations MUST reject encoded values that are too large for them to parse. Implementations MUST be tested for overflows. No leading zeros.</t>
  <t hangText='BASE64URL'>
  Base64-URL encoding. See <xref target="RFC4648"></xref>, Section 5.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="bitmask" title="Bitmask">
<t>Any system that accepts crypto-conditions must be able to state its supported algorithms. It must be possible to verify that all algorithms used in a certain condition are indeed supported even if the fulfillment is not available yet. Therefore, all conditions and fulfillments contain a bitmask to express the required features. Implementations provide a bitmask of features they support.</t>

<t>Each bit represents a different suite of features. Each type of crypto-condition depends on one or more feature suites. If an implementation supports all feature suites that a certain type depends on, the implementation MUST support that condition type. The list of known types and feature suites is the IANA-maintained <xref target="crypto-conditions-type-registry">Crypto-Condition Type Registry</xref> .</t>

<t>To save space, the bitmask is encoded as a variable-length integer.</t>

Implementations which index conditions MUST use the entire string or binary encoded condition as the key, not just the fingerprint - as different conditions of different types may have the same fingerprint.

For most condition types, the fingerprint is a cryptographically secure hash of the data which defines the condition, such as a public key.</t>

<t>The fingerprint of a preimage condition is the hash of an arbitrary value. The payload of a preimage fulfillment is the hashed arbitrary value before hashing, also known as the preimage. Conditions that use this preimage MUST also rely on a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm.

By creating a hash of a difficult-to-guess 256-bit random or pseudo-random integer it is possible to create a condition which the creator can trivially fulfill by publishing the random value.
